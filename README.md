# Custom Object Detection using YOLOv8

Welcome to the **Custom Object Detection using YOLOv8** project! This repository demonstrates how to utilize the YOLOv8 algorithm for various custom object detection tasks. YOLOv8, developed by Ultralytics, is a state-of-the-art model known for its speed and accuracy in object detection.

## Project Overview

This project includes:

- **Pre-trained Models**: Use of pre-trained YOLOv8 models for quick deployment in object detection tasks.
- **Custom Training**: Instructions on how to train a YOLOv8 model on custom datasets, including single-class and multi-class detection.
- **Data Preparation**: Automated processes for downloading and preparing datasets in YOLO-compatible formats.
- **Integration with Google Colab and Kaggle**: Easy-to-follow notebooks for training and testing models in cloud environments.

## Features

- **Single Class Detection**: Train a YOLOv8 model to recognize a specific object class (e.g., alpacas).
- **Multi-Class Detection**: Develop models to detect multiple classes (e.g., bees, butterflies, ants).
- **PPE Detection**: Implement a model for detecting personal protective equipment (PPE) using YOLOv8.
- **Object Tracking and Counting**: Utilize the `yolo_detect_and_count.py` module for tracking and counting detected objects.

## Directory Structure

The repository contains the following key directories and files:

- **Custom-object-detection-with-YOLOv8**: Contains training and testing files for custom models.
- **PPE-custom-object-detection-with-YOLOv8**: Dedicated to PPE detection tasks.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for training and testing models on Kaggle and Google Colab.
- **Requirements**: A `requirements.txt` file listing all necessary dependencies for the project.
